## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [2026-05-29]: Selected Tesseract.js (OCR) and pdfjs-dist (PDF Parsing) to run client-side for zero cloud cost and offline reliability.
- [2026-05-29]: CoordinateSorter uses dynamic font-height thresholds (D-01) for Y-grouping and 1D X-coordinate clustering (D-04) for tabular alignment.
- [2026-05-29]: DocumentBuilder uses exceljs for XLSX and docx for DOCX output as ArrayBuffer.

### Pending Todos

- Code review for Phase 2 was skipped (quota exhaustion). Consider running `/gsd-code-review 2` when quota recovers.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Review | Phase 2 code review | Deferred (quota) | 2026-05-29 |
